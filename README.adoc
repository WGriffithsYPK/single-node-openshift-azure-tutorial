= single-node-openshift-azure-demo

== Outline 

1. You'll need a working Azure subscription and portal login to complete this demo.
2. Create a Azure RHEL virtual machine and connect to it with SSH.
3. Enable the OpenShift repositories. 
4. Configure Docker, and start a simple "all in one" OpenShift environment.
5. Profit! ... and run labs ;-)

[NOTE]
Instructions may be deliberately brief, encouraging you to look into the answer 
 a little yourself. Don’t be deterred if some steps take you a little longer to 
 find or fix, but do ask for help if you get stuck too long! Work in an 
 innovative way, together :)


== Provision a RHEL virtual machine from the marketplace 

Use common sense details for the VM basics, you should use a SSH key if you have one, otherwise, use a strong password! Most importantly, make sure you deploy to the North Europe region (that’s where some lab materials are - keeps latency low).
