== Outline 

1. You'll need a working Azure subscription and portal login to complete this demo.
2. Create a Azure RHEL virtual machine and connect to it with SSH.
3. Enable the OpenShift repositories. 
4. Configure Docker, and start a simple "all in one" OpenShift environment.
5. Profit! ... and run labs ;-)

[NOTE]
Instructions may be deliberately brief, encouraging you to look into the answer 
 a little yourself. Donâ€™t be deterred if some steps take you a little longer to 
 find or fix, but do ask for help if you get stuck too long! Work in an 
 innovative way, together :)
